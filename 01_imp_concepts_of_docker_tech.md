# Important concepts of Docker Technology  

1.  Containers
2.  Images
3. Registries and Repositories


## Images

- Images are read only templates used to create containers.
- Images are created with docker build command.
- Images are composed of layers of other images.
- Images are stored in a docker registry.



## Container 

- If an image is a class then a container is an instance of the class.
- Containers are encapsulations of environments in which we run the applications.
- Containers are lightweight and portable.
- Containers are created from images.
- A container contains all the dependencies needed to run the application.  



## Registries and Repositories

- A registry is where we store our images.

- We can host our own registries or use dockerhub.

- Inside registry, images are stored as repositories.

- In simple terms *Registry* is similar to *github* and *Repositories* are similar to *github repos*.
